Sensors are considered electrical, opto-electrical, or electronic devices composed of 
specialty electronics or sensitive materials, for determining if there is a presense 
of particular entity or function. Detectors and Transducers are also categorize with  sensors.
Electrical inputs from sensors can be read through an analog or digital signal. There
are a variety of sensors in the market, and they are as listed below:


-Vision and Imaging: electronic devices that detect the presence of objects or colors within their view and converts this information into a visual image.
-Temperature: electronic devices that detect thermal parameters and provide signals to the inputs of control and display devices
-Radiation: electronic devices that sense the presence of alpha, beta, or gamma particles and provides a signal to counter or display devices.
-Proximity: electronic devices used to detect the presence of nearby objects through non-contacting means.
-Pressure: electro-mechanical devices that detect forces per unit area in gases or liquids and provide signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Position: electronic devices used to sense the positions of valves, doors, throttles, etc. and provide signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Photoelectric: eletrical devices that sense objects passing within their field of detection, also capable of detecting color cleankiness and location if needed.
-Particle: electronic devices used to sense dust and other airborne particulates and provides signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Motion: electronic devices that can sense the movement or stoppage of parts, people, etc. and provide signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Metal: electronic or electro-mechanical devices used to sense the presence of metal in the variety of situations ranging from packages to people.
-Level: electronic or electro-mechanical devices used for determining the height of gases, liquids, or solids in tanks or bins and provide signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Leak: electronic devices used for identifying or monitoring the unwanted discharge of liquids or gases.
-Humidity: electronic devices that measure the amount of water in the air and convert these measurements into signals that can be used as inputs of control or display devices.
-Gas and Chemical: electronic devices used to sense the presence and properties of various gases or chemicals.
-Force: electronic devices that measure various parameters related to forces such as weight, torque, load, etc. and provide signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Flow: electronic or electro-mechanical devices used to sense the movement of gases, liquids, or solids and provide signals to the inputs of control or display devices.
-Flaw: electronic devices used in a variety of manufacturing processes to uncover inconsistencies on surfaces or in underlying materials such as welds.
-Flame: optoelectronic devices used to sense the presence and quality of fire and provide signals to the inputs of control devices.
-Electrical: electronic devices that sense current, voltage, etc. and provide signals to the inputs of control devices or display devices.
-Contact: any type of sensing device that functions to detect a condition by relying on physical tocuh or contact between the sensor and the object being observed or monitored.
-Non-Contact: devices that do not require a physical touch between the sensor and the object being monitored in order to function. 



So, when developing the code for testing the probable sensors, I only considered the basic
functions such as HIGH and LOW for digital sensors, and a 10 bit (0-1023) resolution read
from the Arduino's ADC for analog sensors. There are a variety of sensors and some can come 
in built-in modules where they can output different signals such as PWM,I2C, SPI,etc. 
Therefore, I compartmentalize the code in order to expand the code in the future if necessary. 
 

[***********************************DIGITAL ALGORITHM***************************************]

When considering the code for a basic digital output sensor I thought of the well-known PIR
motion sensor. When a motion is detected it outputs a low signal on its signal pin. Now, to 
test a device like this you simply need to capture and compare its different states 
(HIGH and LOW). So as follow read and capture it current state, create motion event, read and 
capture new state, then compare old and new state and it should be different.

1) Create variable to capture digital signal, state
2) Read sensor signal pin and store value in 'state' (without any event)
3) Create event (motion, vibration, etc.)
4) Read new signal of pin and compare to stored value in 'state'
5) If both old and new signal values are the same, return false for sensor failed test
6) otherside return true for passed test

Steps 2 to 4 can be repeated several times to solidify sensor's test diagnosis. 



[*************************************ANALOG ALGORITHM**************************************]

When considering the code for a basic analog output sensor, I thought of a photo-resistor. The 
increase of light exposure over the sensor will proportionally increase the resistance. Now as 
mentioned before the Arduino's ADC has a 10-bit resolution giving a range of 0 to 1023 for an
input signal ranging from 0-5v (or 0-3.3v). You would test this by capturing different readings 
along that range corresponding to how much light is being exposed. I chose to capture no light, 
seeking the value of zero, medium light exposure for any value within that range, and maximum
light exposure for a targeted value of 1023. If the desired targets are reached it constitute as
a pass in the procedure. 

1) Create a variable to hold the read value 
2) Create a loop to iterate through the number of values you are seeking (our case, 3)
3) Read sensor signal and compare it to target '0', if equal it pass otherwise fail
4) Create event (light exposure, medium )
5) Read sensor signal, should be within the 10 bit resolution for a pass 
6) Create event #2 (maximum light exposure)
7) Read sensor signal and compare it to target '1023' if equal it otherwise fail
